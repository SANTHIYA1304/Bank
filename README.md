The Bank Fund Transfer System is a console-based Java application developed using JDBC and Oracle Database to perform basic banking operations such as checking account balance and transferring funds between accounts. The system validates account numbers, checks for sufficient balance, and ensures safe money transfer using proper transaction handling (commit and rollback). It follows a layered architecture (Bean, DAO, Service, Utility, Main) to maintain clean code structure and separation of responsibilities.
